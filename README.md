This is a final project of spring2015 CSCI2270, created by Theerarun Tubnonghee.

1. Project Summary
 - Have you ever wonder to travel around the world? Have you ever done some calculation of the cost before taking off? I have been thinking about it for a while.
Since thie semester, I have learnt about the graph data structure, and the assignments. I am kind of want to make something that applied to this knowledge. I wonder
if I would build a travel plan to all cities I want to go, and put them into the travel analyzer to calculate how much of the travel, and time costs. Another question has risen.
What if I select to drive instead of flying, how different would it cost in both travel and time costs. Maybe, I will add the blissfulness along the road into my account.
Firstly, I will use ROADMAP file, and FLIGHTMAP file to insert my primary information. Then, I could add any city later on. I print out the road, flight map.
What if I want to travel to along some cities in the map, not around the world. How much does it cost me, in money and time? What if I want to take the shortest path.
What if I want to drive along the road and visit least number of cities. Breath-first Search could help out what nearby cities are. Depth-first Search could help
out what a possible path to the destination. Dijkstra's algorithm could help out what shortest path I should take. However, that is only the travel cost.
What if there is some choice of taking a plane or driving a car. What if the time is limited. These are the choices that my program want to find out and give
out solutions to users.

2. How to Run
 - Firstly, the program will run by reading a ROADMAP file, and FLIGHTMAP file in command line argument. 
*However, you will need these file to completely run the program.
 - Secondly, you can print the map to check the cities, roads, and flights.
 - By selecting Menu, it will calculate and implement each function.
 - There is no other dependent file; other than ROADMAP.txt and FLIGHTMAP.txt which I will provide in the repository folder.

3. Dependencies
 - There is no other dependent file; other than ROADMAP.txt and FLIGHTMAP.txt which I will provide in the repository folder.

4. System Requirements
 - Since I will build a simple program using terminal, All OS-platform is worked.
 - No additional system requirement.
